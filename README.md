# data-analytics-case-study
My first case study with Google play store data where i try handling and cleaning the data, perform some sanity checks and manage the outliers present in the data. 
The team at Google Play Store wants to develop a feature that would enable them to boost visibility for the most promising apps. 
Now, this analysis would require a preliminary understanding of the features that define a well-performing app. You can have questions like:
* Does a higher size or price necessarily mean that an app would perform better than the other apps?
* Or does a higher number of installs give a clear picture of which app would have a better rating than others?
All these insights can be pulled from the analysis of the data as shown in the notebook.
